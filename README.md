This is a tool that I am developing in order to scrape property values off the website of the boulder county commisioner. This is to support the cause of affordable housing in the city of Longmont. We want to show the city council that multi-family housing is more beneficial than single family housing. This part of the project LHS-map is the frontned. You can select any area using multiple triangle polygons and then get the adresses for that area. This will eventually plug into the webscraper that will probably be made in Python. Eventually this code will be hosted on a EC2 instance. The api keys are not deprecated so you have to change them to your own if you use this tool
